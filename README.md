# w3resource-Java  
This repository contains my solutions to Java programming exercises from the [w3resource Java Exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/) website.

## Purpose  
- To practice and improve my Java programming skills.  
- To provide a structured catalogue of solutions aligned with w3resource exercises.  
- To document my progress and learning journey in Java.

## Naming Convention

- Files are named with leading zeros so they sort correctly (e.g., _001HelloWorld.java, _010FormulaComputation.java).
- Each fileâ€™s class name matches the file name.
- Folder names correspond to w3resource exercise sections (Basic, Methods, OOP, etc).

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GhifarMR/w3resource-Java.git
2. Navigate to the folder of interest.
3. Open the .java file in your Java IDE (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse).
4. Compile and run the solution to understand the exercise and output.
